# That New-Mac Smell

A script I maintain for setting up new macOS-based systems for my own personal use. Pushed to GitHub in case anyone wants to use it as a starting-point for their own script, mainly.

Honestly, I use this as more a pick-and-choose copy/paste source rather than a "run it and go get a brew" type solution. Many of the `--cask` installs will want to escalate to install so you'll be entering your password a few times.
